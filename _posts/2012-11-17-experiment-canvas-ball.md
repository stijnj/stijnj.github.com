title: Experiment - playing with canvas and basic math
excerpt:
    For a long time I wanted to play a bit with canvas and some basic animations. This experiment shows how to move an object in a specific angle and how to handle collission with walls.

For a long time I wanted to play a bit with canvas and some basic animations. This experiment shows how to move an object in a specific angle and how to handle collission with walls.

The fun part was that I had to dig really deep in my memory on how to use `sin` and `cos` in order to get all the calculations right. Luckily my dad has a physics degree so he quickly brought me up to speed.

Take a look at [this experiment](/experiments/canvas-ball/)
